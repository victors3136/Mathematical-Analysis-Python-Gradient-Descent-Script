# UniWorkSem1-GradientDescent
Small gradient descent plotting script I made as part of my Mathematical Analysis Course during my first semester of univeristy.

# Here is the assignment text
 Consider the quadratic function f : R^2 → R, f (x, y) = 1/2* (x^2 + b*y^2) with b > 0
 and the gradient descent algorithm for finding its minimum
  (x_(k+1), y_(k+1)) = (x_k, y_k) − s_k* ∇f (x_k, y_k),
 where the step size s_k > 0 is chosen (exact line search) to minimize the function
  ϕ(s) = f (xk+1, yk+1) = f ((xk, yk) − s∇f (xk, yk)), ϕ′(sk) = 0.
  For b = 1, 1/2 , 1/5 , 1/10, plot some gradient descent iterations and the relevant contour lines of f .
